#1) Make a int variable named a. Now make an if statement, and if a is more than
#5, print out "a is more than 5."
a = 5
if(a > 5):
    print("a is more than 5")


#2) Make a boolean variable named b. Now make an if statement, and if b is True
#print out "b is True."
b = 0
if(b==0):
    print("b is True")

#3) Make an int variable named c. Now make an if/elif statement, and if c is 
#more than 0, print "c is positive". Else if c is less than 0, print "c is
#negative".
c = 1
if(c > 0):
    print("c is postitive")
else:
    print("c is negative")


#4) Make an int variable named d. Now make an if/elif/else statement, and if 
#d is more than 0, print "d is positive". Else if d is less than 0, print "c is
#negative". Else, print "d is zero".
d = -1
if(d > 0):
    print("d is positive")
elif(d < 0):
    print("d is negative")
else:
    print("d is zero")


#5) Make an if statement with any comparison, with a common SYNTAX error.
f = 1
if(f > 0)
print("f is positive")
