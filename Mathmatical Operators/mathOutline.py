#1) Make two string variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

var = "one" + " new" + " variable"


#2) Make two int variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

y = 4 + 4

#3) Make two int variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x = 8 - 4 

#4) Make two float variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

z = 4.5 - 2.5

#5) Make two int variables and use the * operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

v = 4 * 4

#6) Make one string variable and one int variable and use the * operator 
#to combine them into one new variable.

j = "jonas" * 3 

#7) Make two int variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

m = 9 / 3 

#8) Make two float variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

g = 4.3 / 5.2

#9) Make two int variables and use the % operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

r = 3 % 3

#10) Make two int variables and use the // operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

o = 8 // 7

#11) Make two int variables and use the ** operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

w = 3 ** 5

#12) Make any type of operation with a common SYNTAX error

t = 9 5
