#EX) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the and operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named a. Print the variable.
one = True
two = False
a = one and two  
print(a)

#1) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the and operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named a. Print the variable.
ap = True
og= True
a = ap and og
print(a)


#2) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the or operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named b. Print the variable.
frog = True
bear = False
b = frog or bear
print(b)


#3) Make one boolean variable. Put the variable after the not. Store this 
#expression in a variable named c. Print the variable.
J = "Green"
c = not (J == "Green")
print(c)


#4) Make a logical expression with one of the common SYNTAX errors.
J = "Green"
d = not (J="Green")
print(d)
