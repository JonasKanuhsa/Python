Fill in this outline as the instructor goes through the lesson.

#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

var = ("cow" == "milk")
print(var)
#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

m = (3 == 3)
print(m)

#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

n = (6  > 5)
print(n)

#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

h = (2 < 9)
print(h)

#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

u = (5 >= 45)
print(u)

#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

i = (56 <= 98) 
print(i)

#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.
b = 4 = 4
